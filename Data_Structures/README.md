#### getthesingle.c
You are given an array of integers where every element appears twice except for one. Find the value of that single one. Note that the array is non-empty.  
**Input**  
The input consists of the number of test cases, m (1 <=m <= 1000), in the first line and followed by m test cases.  
Each test case consists of two lines. The first line is a number n (1 <= n <= 1000) denoting the length of the given array. The second line consists of the elements of the array separated by space.  
An example is as follows,  

      3  
      3  
      2 2 1  
      5  
      4 1 2 1 2  
      1  
      1  
**Output **  
The output should be m lines. Each line corresponds to the value of that singlenumber in each array.

      1  
      4  
      1  
**Follow up**  
Could you implement a solution with a linear time complexity and without using extra memory?
